        of quality.<br/> <br/> We are dedicated to creating luxury design, that is
        authentically crafted. Through using honestly sourced raw materials, we
        can ensure that each design will last for generations. Over the years,
        The Rug Company has collaborated with some of the world’s leading
        creatives, from esteemed fashion houses to profound artists – each
